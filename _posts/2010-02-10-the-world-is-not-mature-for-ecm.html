<p>Lee Dallas in recent blog post...write about "The Problem with ECM". Really interesting.</p>
<p>"The problem with ECM is that it is too big to buy but too small to dream about. Once you step out of the tactical realm specific realities of documents, web content and image content within a single business seems constrained. The information world is a much bigger, connected and interdependent space. This new strategic destination is a pan-enterprise concept."</p>

<p>More thoughts related to this are on Joe Shepley post:</p>
<p>http://joeshepley.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/no-one-cares-about-ecm/</p>
<p>“ECM is a means and not an end,”<br />
“a way to reach a goal and not that goal itself, valuable to the organization only insofar as it supports, enables, and furthers the work of the organization,” i.e., the products and services it provides to its customers</p>
