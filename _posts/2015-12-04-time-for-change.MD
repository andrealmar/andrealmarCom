There it comes a time in life where everything is doing good and suddenly you got hit by a hurricane. Well no one is safe and this could happen with anyone. It happens to me a couple days ago. For a number of reasons I left my old job (as a consultant for a major telecom company here in Brazil) and find myself thinking: "What I'm going to do next? What is my next move?" The obvious next step would be to go to the usual job boards here in Brazil and start searching for a new gig. But surprisingly this was not that I did.  <br />  
We are in late 2015 and I thought this could be a good time to calm down and carefully choose my next steps. As I'm getting older (I'm 30 years old at the moment turning 31 in January) I start to look for other things that are more important than money itself. And I found myself thinking a lot in **Autonomy**. This word can mean a lot of things like:<br />

* the right or condition of self-government, especially in a particular sphere.<br />
* freedom from external control or influence; independence.<br />

But in my case Autonomy means that I can have an equal relation with my employer or my customers.  
**Meaning:** I can work with really nice customers and work with the best and learn from them. I can work from my home in Brazil or I can work from a co-working space in Thailand. No more 9-5. Results, delivery and satisfied customer. This is what matters. It's up to me.  As my mentor Henrique Bastos used to say:  <br />  
```
Life is risky. The big question is whether the way you walk is up to you, or if it's defined by others.
```  
<br />
Take care
