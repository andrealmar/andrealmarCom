There it comes a time in life where everything is doing good and suddenly you got hit by a hurricane. Well no one is safe and this could happen with anyone. It happens to me a couple days ago. For a number of reasons I left my old job (as a consultant for a major telecom company here in Brazil) and find myself thinking: "What I'm going to do next? What is my next move?" The obvious next step would be to go to the usual job boards here in Brazil and start searching for a new gig. But surprisingly this was not that I did.  <br />  
We are in late 2015 and I thought this could be a good time to calm down and carefully choose my next steps. As I'm getting older (I'm 30 years old at the moment turning 31 in January) I start to look for other things that are more important than money itself. And I found myself thinking a lot in **Autonomy**. This word can mean a lot of things like:<br />

* the right or condition of self-government, especially in a particular sphere.<br />
* freedom from external control or influence; independence.<br />

But in my case Autonomy means that I can do what I want at the time I want.  
**Meaning:** I can work with really nice customers and work with the best and learn from them. I can work from my home in Brazil or I can work from a co-working space in Thailand. No more 9-5. Results, delivery and satisfied customer. This is what matters. It's up to me.  
<br />
Then I started to search for jobs that reflect this kind of thinking. I came across and I've found [TopTal](http://www.toptal.com). I really liked TopTal's philosophy and way of working and I decided to apply for the [TopTal Web development network](http://www.toptal.com/web).
They even have a Python Interviewing guide that I'm going to dig in and learn more about what they are looking for. <br />  
[The Vital Guide to Python Interviewing](http://www.toptal.com/python#hiring-guide "Python Interviewing")<br />  

<br />
Another thing that really got my attention was this post from Breanden Beneschott: [How to Travel While Working: The Traveling Engineer's Survival Guide](http://www.toptal.com/freelance/the-traveling-engineers-survival-guide "The Traveling Engineer's Survival Guide")<br />
<br />
Man I would love to travel while working since traveling and getting to know other cultures are one of my deepest passions.
So I'm here writing this blog post to share my experiences during the interview process. I don't know yet if I'm going to be successful or not but I'll give it a try and whatever the result is it will worth it for sure.  
<br />
Take care
