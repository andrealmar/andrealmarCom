Hi,
I’m writing just to give you my feedback about the Oracle Enterprise Content Management 11g certification exam.
Well, what I can say is that not too easy even if you work with Oracle UCM for a couple years.<br />
My study planning guide to this certification was the following:</p>
Books:  <br />

- The Oracle Universal Content Management Handbook – Dmitri Khanine
- The Definitive Guide to Stellent Content Server Development – Bex Huff
- Transforming Infoglut! A Pragmatic Strategy for Oracle Enterprise Content Management – Andy MacMillan & Bex Huff

Tutorials:  <br />
Just follow the labs given in Oracle trainings/workshops about UCM.  <br />
<br />Official Documentation from Oracle:  <br />

<br /><p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E10316_01/ouc.htm">Oracle UCM 10g Documentation</a></p>
<p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E21764_01/ecm.htm">Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g Documentation - Enterprise Content Management Suite</a></p>
<br />
It was basically this.
About the exam, it covers all ECM Suite stack, UCM, URM, IRM, IBR, ODC, ODDC, OFR, I/PM and so on.
So be prepared to answer questions like:<br />

- Which metadata are added when we install SiteStudio module on Content Server?
- Which application integrations come out-of-the-box with ECM?
- What are the predefined Security Groups by default on UCM ?  

A total of 69 questions to be answered in 2 hours.<br />
My advice is: Be prepared! <br />  
Cheers,
