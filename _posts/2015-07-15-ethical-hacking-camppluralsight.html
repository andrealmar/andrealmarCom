<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This month I'm enrolled on Camp Pluralsight. It's funny because you can learn and at the same time you enter for a chance to win awesome prizes like an Apple Watch and a trip to Silicon Valley Comic Con. To start I choose the Ethical Hacking: Understanding Ethical Hacking course. It's very interesting. Below are some facts that I learned on the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2017 the Global Cyber Security Market is expected to sky-rocket to USD120.1 Billion from USD 64.7 Billion in 2011.</li>
<li>Estimated Annual cost of Global Cybercrime is USD 375 Billion - If you took all the revenues from the top technology companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Ebay, Yahoo, Apple and Netflix) combined you wouldn't get close to what Cybercrime is doing.</li>
<li>Cybercrime Victims per year - 556 million. Breaking down it's 1.5 million per day or 18 victims per second.</li>
<li>Over 657 Million of Identities Exposed (40 Million victims from USA, 54 million victims from Turkey).</li>
<li>2008 - 1 billion devices connected to the internet.</li>
<li>2014 - 1.4 trillion devices connected to the internet.</li>
<li>2015 - 30% increase = 4.9 Trillion devices on the internet.</li>
<li>More than 600.000 Facebook accounts are compromised every single day.</li>
<li>59% ex-employees admit to steal company data when they leave their jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that being said there is a question:</p>
<p>How protected do you feel?</p>
