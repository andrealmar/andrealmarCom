<p>Hello ALL,</p>
<p>I used to blog in <a href="http://andrealmar.wordpress.com">http://andrealmar.wordpress.com</a>. I could help a lot of people with my articles and I'm glad I did that. But I was missing one thing: CONSISTENCY. Motivated by John Sonmez (simpleprogrammer.com) I'm back on blogosphere and I will do my best to achive my goals and be consistent in blogging.</p>
<p>So I think I can say: "I'm back in style"</p>
<p>See ya.</p>
