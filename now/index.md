## What is a “now page”?

Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
<br />  
Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
<br />  
So a page on a person’s website, that tells you what this person is focused on at this stage in their life, is called a “now page”. See examples by browsing [NowNowNow](http://www.nownownow.com).
<br />  
Although it’s normal to make the web address “/now”, just like it’s usually “/about” and “/contact” in those other examples, the URL could be anything.
